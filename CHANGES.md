# 1.2.0 -- UNRELEASED

Added new functions `constructor-fn` and `apply-constructor-fns` which can be
used to decrease verbosity in a configuration.

# 1.1.0 -- 29 Mar 2018

Many functions exposed only for testing have been excluded from
documentation. These functions have the ^:no-doc metadata.

The `merged-subconfig` function has been merged into the `merged-config`
function.
